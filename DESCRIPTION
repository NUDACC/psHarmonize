Description: Functions which facilitate harmonization of data from multiple 
    different datasets. Data harmonization involves taking data sources with 
    differing values, creating coding instructions to create a harmonized 
    set of values, then making those data modifications. 'psHarmonize' will 
    assist with data modification once the harmonization instructions are 
    written. Coding instructions are written by the user to create a 
    "harmonization sheet". This sheet catalogs variable names, domains 
    (e.g. clinical, behavioral, outcomes), provides R code instructions for 
    mapping or conversion of data, specifies the variable name in the 
    harmonized data set, and tracks notes. The package will then harmonize 
    the source datasets according to the harmonization sheet to create a 
    harmonized dataset. Once harmonization is finished, the package also has 
    functions that will create descriptive statistics using 'RMarkdown'.
